"""A small in-memory, fixed-window rate limiter for brute-force protection.

Keyed by an arbitrary string (e.g. client IP). Thread-safe because FastAPI runs
sync endpoints in a worker thread pool. Sufficient for a single-process
deployment; for multi-process/multi-host, back this with Redis instead.
(Ported from the user's fleetbox app.)
